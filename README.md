#Correlation Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes correlations found in the dataset. It's crucial to interpret these correlations with caution due to the nature of the data:

Correlation of 1.0: Cannot be considered an accurate positive correlation due to lack of historical data. It's deemed flawed.
Correlations around 0.97: While suspicious, these correlations may become useful with additional data collection.
Correlations of 0.49, 0.50, 0.62: These values are particularly interesting and merit close monitoring.
Conclusion
Understanding correlations is pivotal for drawing insights from the dataset. Future updates and refinements in data collection could enhance the reliability of these findings.
